## 1. Conceptual Difference

| Aspect           | **CTE (Common Table Expression)**                                            | **Subquery (especially Correlated Subquery)**                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**   | A temporary named result set that exists only for the duration of the query. | A query nested inside another query (either in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE). |
| **Reusability**  | Can be referenced multiple times in the main query (if used multiple times). | Each subquery runs independently each time it’s called.                 |
| **Readability**  | Much easier to read and maintain, since logic is separated clearly.          | Harder to read when nested deeply.                                      |
| **Optimization** | CTEs can be optimized by the SQL engine similar to views or inline queries.  | Correlated subqueries may be re-executed per row (can be slower).       |
| **Debugging**    | Easy — you can test the CTE part alone.                                      | Harder — the logic is buried inside the main query.                     |
| **Scope**        | Only exists for that SQL statement.                                          | Exists within the scope where it’s written.                             |

##  2. Performance Difference

Let’s compare performance for **your example**:

###  CTE Version

```sql
WITH EmployeeSales AS (
    SELECT employee_id, SUM(sale_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT e.employee_name, es.total_sales
FROM employees e
JOIN EmployeeSales es ON e.employee_id = es.employee_id;
```

* **How it works:**
  The database computes the CTE **once** — it groups and sums the `sales` table, producing a small intermediate table.
  Then it performs a simple join with `employees`.

* **Performance:**
  - Efficient — especially if `sales` is large.
  - Executes aggregation once.

---

###  Subquery Version

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name,
       (SELECT SUM(s.sale_amount)
        FROM sales s
        WHERE s.employee_id = e.employee_id) AS total_sales
FROM employees e;
```

* **How it works:**
  For **each employee row**, the inner query runs separately to find their total sales.

* **Performance:**
  - Potentially inefficient — if there are 500 employees, the subquery executes 500 times.
  - In large datasets, this becomes **much slower** than a CTE or JOIN approach.

##  3. When to Use Each

| Use Case                                                        | Recommended Approach |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| You need clean, reusable logic (especially multiple steps).     |  **CTE**            |
| You want to break down complex queries for readability.         |  **CTE**            |
| You only need a one-off small lookup for each row.              |  **Subquery**      |
| You need to reference the same logic multiple times in a query. |  **CTE**            |
| You want maximum performance with large tables.                 |  **CTE + JOIN**     |

##  4. Summary

| Category                      | Winner           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Readability**               |  CTE           |
| **Performance (large data)**  |  CTE + JOIN    |
| **Simplicity for small data** | Subquery is fine |
| **Reusability**               |  CTE           |

---

 **Conclusion:**

> **CTEs are generally better** than correlated subqueries in terms of readability, maintainability, and performance (especially on large datasets).
> Subqueries are okay for quick, simple lookups or when performance impact is negligible.
